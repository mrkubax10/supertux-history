# Current State

The Computer/Geek theme (laptop enemies, bsods) which is visible in the current CVS version will be dropped and be replaced with something more comical.

# Enemies

## Evil Penguin

The Evil Penguin should look similar to Tux, it will probally have another color and another shaped bill. Ranges of attack might be something simple such as spitting balls or eggs at Tux. There might even be multiple levels of evil penguins with different behaviours (fire, ice).

## Mr. Bomb

Pretty much every game has some kind of exploding enemy, so SuperTux should have something like that too. For the moment this should be our Mr. Bomb, a plain and simple Bomb running on its tiny feed.

## Mr. IceBlock

Mr. IceBlock could be the most basic enemy in SuperTux, he just walks around without having any 'special attacks' or something like that. Jumping on Mr. IceBlock should flatten him and thus kill him.

## Mr. Snowball

Little Mr. Snowball is a basic enemey which might start to roll if kicked with a Iceblock or on other issues.

## Bouncing Snowball

A bouncing/rolling ball that bounces around on the playfield

## Flying Snowball

Flies vertically up and down a bit

## Mr. Crystal

When Tux jumps on MrCrystal, MrCrystal will break into pieces.

## Spiky

Spiky has spikes which makes it impossible for Tux to kill him by jumping on him.

## Jumpy Spiky

Moneybag replacement, jumps up and down and is not killable by jumping

## Fish

Jumps up and down

## Unsorted



## Sprites

The following is a list of basic sprites that are needed, more can never be bad, but it should especially made sure that the few here are good and smooth. The width/height are only meant as guideline, a bit larger/smaller is ok and recomment, since overlap of graphics can produce a more cleaner look in the final game. Some of the other pages here contain sketches of the sprites.

* SmallTux - 32x32, ie. Tux without extras
* Tux - 64x32, ie. Tux with 'size' extra
* SuperTux - 64x32, ie Tux with 'size' and 'firepower' extra
* Mr. Iceblock - 32x32 most basic enemy, needs two or three frames for a walking, at least one for dieing
* Mr. Bomb - 32x32 a basic enemy that explodes after being kill, needs two or three for walking, at least two for being dead plus at least one for explosion

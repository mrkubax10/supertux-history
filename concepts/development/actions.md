# Actions

## BlowFlyer

The BlowFlyer or BaloonTux action should be a temporary limited action in which Tux fills his body with air (helium?!) and is thus able to fly for a short time, ie as long as he can go without breathing. The end of the flight should be announced by Tux changing color and catching for air.

## ButtJump

The ButtJump is a smash attack onto the ground, which generates a small shockwave which affects all enemies in a near radius. Reaction to the shockwave for enemies might be to fall upside down or something similar. The ButtJump might also be used to break special tiles in the ground. The ButtJump is triggered by pressing and holding the down-key while in a jump. The ButtJump can't be interruppted.

## Ice Flower

The IceFlower could be one of the extra that Tux can collect it might be able to resize him to SuperTux or give him other special abbilities.

## Slider

Tux will be able to make use of smooth terrain my using the slide action. By using the slider action Tux will jump on its belly and thus slide speedy down the hill. Terrain that is formed like a ramp should allow him to make huge jumps, which would be impossible without the slide action. While sliding downhill Tux shall be invulnerable by normal enemies, howewer special enemies with spikes or so, might still be able to stop him.
Exact details on how the sliding will work have to be worked out, but it might get a rather central role in gameplay.

## Flapping

Once in air Tux should be allowed to flap with his wings. They are not enough to let him fly, but should allow him to get some additional air-time (like a small double-jump).

## Soap

Tux migth be able to eat some soap and thus be able to spit out bobbles, bubbles them self should be useable as steps to reach higher places and might be able to caputer enemies.

## Rope

Tux will be able to use a rope (in one form or another). The rope should be usefull for both swinging around and for capturing or disableing enemies.

## Running

SuperTux might be able to run, running will enable higher and wider jumps and other things that require some kind of 'boost'. If running will be automatically or require the press of a 'run' button, hasn't been decided and might depend on how the rope is used.

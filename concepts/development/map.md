# Graphics

SuperTux will use OpenGL-only in the future, software rendering is obsolete and will get removed has soon as feature get introduced that are only doable in OpenGL.

# Level Format

There hasn't been any finial decissions on the level format, however what we need is basically something that can:

* hold multiple tilemaps per level
* hold scriptable trickers and such
* hold the position of enemies and there state

# Tiles

SuperTux should feature 5 basic tile shapes:

* empty
* full
* 100% slope
* 50% slope
* 200% slope

In addition to them it will feature them in mirrored form and in a form that allows two 50% tiles to form a smooth slope. With these basic tile shapes it should be possible to form reasonably smooth circles and smooth shapes into the terrain.

# Tile Types

Beside normal and opaque tiles, there will be quite a few different tile types:

* ice tiles, which make the ground slippery and controlls harder
* slime tiles/water tiles, which make movement slower
* lava/fire tiles, which kill Tux or rob him some energie

# Raising Lava

To speed up gameplay a bit and to provide a raising danger to Tux, some levels might feature raising lava, acid or poising gas that will come from below or from the left and will require the player to quickly advance to survive.

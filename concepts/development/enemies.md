# Current State

The Computer/Geek theme (laptop enemies, bsods) which is visible in the current CVS version will be dropped and be replaced with something more comical.

# Enemies

## Evil Penguin

The Evil Penguin should look similar to Tux, it will probally have another color and another shaped bill. Ranges of attack might be something simple such as spitting balls or eggs at Tux. There might even be multiple levels of evil penguins with different behaviours (fire, ice).

## Mr. Bomb

Pretty much every game has some kind of exploding enemy, so SuperTux should have something like that too. For the moment this should be our Mr. Bomb, a plain and simple Bomb running on its tiny feed.

## Mr. IceBlock

Mr. IceBlock could be the most basic enemy in SuperTux, he just walks around without having any 'special attacks' or something like that. Jumping on Mr. IceBlock should flatten him and thus kill him.

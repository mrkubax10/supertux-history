* **02.12.2004** - It looks like we have our first fansite. You can find it at [SuperTux: The Fan Site](https://web.archive.org/web/20041214101221/http://cd.bromley.ac.uk/supertux/). It includes game information, tips, cheats and more.

* **03.04.2005** - After a rather long break where everyone has been busy with other things, we are finally back on SuperTux. The main goals of milestone 2 were discussed in an IRC meeting yesterday; the [meeting log](http://supertux-community.github.io/supertux-website-2005-2006/wiki/index.php/Meeting_log_(2005-04-02)) is available on the [SuperTux wiki](http://supertux-community.github.io/supertux-website-2005-2006/wiki/).

* **13.06.2005** - To (hopefully) keep you happy while waiting for milestone 2, we decided to release another Bonus Island featuring a bunch of new contributed and official levels. The webmaster of the [SuperTux Fan Site](https://web.archive.org/web/20050619074613/http://cd.bromley.ac.uk/supertux/) provided an assorted set of levels that have been submitted to his site to be included on Bonus Island 2. If you created a level that you would like to appear in the next release, please [send it to us](mailto:supertux-devel@berlios.de) during the next two weeks.

* **30.06.2005** - The level submission deadline for SuperTux 0.1.3 is over - the second Bonus Island will contain 20 new levels, four from the SuperTux Team and sixteen contributed by players. Expect a release around next week. For all of you waiting for milestone 2: We still have no idea when it'll be ready, but we are all putting a lot of our free time into it. There has already been quite some progress, and there's more to come.

* **09.07.2005** - SuperTux 0.1.3 has been released! New features include a second Bonus Island with 28 new levels as well as custom world map support and a few bugfixes. Get the source package at the [download section](https://supertux-community.github.io/supertux-website-2005-2006/wiki/index.php/Download/Installation/), binary packages will follow soon. A compatible version of Flexlay with world map support is available from the Flexlay SVN repository; you can download it by using the following command: "svn checkout svn://svn.berlios.de/flexlay/branches/flexlay-0.0.2". A big "Thank you" goes out to everyone who contributed to this release!

* **21.08.2005** - The [download page](http://supertux-community.github.io/supertux-website-2005-2006/wiki/index.php/Download/Installation) now has additional binary packages for SuperTux 0.1.3, including a version for MacOS X 10.3 or later as well as an (unofficial) Windows build.

* **18.09.2005** - Due to unbearable amounts of spam we received on the mailing list, we decided to close it for non-subscribed people. If you don't want to subscribe you can still send a message to the list, but it will have to be approved by a moderator first, which means that it'll take a bit longer and you will receive an email saying that your message is waiting for approval. You can also send your email directly to one of the team members who can then forward it to the list. We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience but with all that spam we had no choice.

* **18.09.2005** - About our decision to make OpenGL a requirement for SuperTux Milestone 2, please see [this link](http://cd.bromley.ac.uk/supertux/forums/viewtopic.php?id=106). There's also a poll [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20060503110419/http://home.arcor.de/firefrog/su1.html) where you can state wether or not you will be able to play milestone 2 if it requires OpenGL (please be honest!).

* **20.09.2005** - A few weeks ago, SuperTux 0.1.3 received an [award](https://web.archive.org/web/20060620052112/http://mac.softpedia.com/progClean/SuperTux-Clean-9049.html) for not containing any adware, spyware or viruses. Apparently it's easier these days to point out software that does not contain malicious code... :-)

* **20.10.2005** - We finally have an official windows installer ready. Download it [here](http://download.berlios.de/supertux/supertux-0.1.3-setup.exe).
